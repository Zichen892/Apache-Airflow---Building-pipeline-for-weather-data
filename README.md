Overview
========

This project used airflow to fetch data from https://api.open-meteo.com. Then transform data to dictionary, then load to postgres. The purpose of this project is to develop an ETL pipeline in real time. 

Project Contents
================

This project contains following files and folders:

- dags: This folder contains the Python files for Airflow DAGs. By default, this directory includes one example DAG:
    - `example_astronauts`: This DAG shows a simple ETL pipeline example that queries the list of astronauts currently in space from the Open Notify API and prints a statement for each astronaut. The DAG uses the TaskFlow API to define tasks in Python, and dynamic task mapping to dynamically print a statement for each astronaut. For more on how this DAG works, see our [Getting started tutorial](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/learn/get-started-with-airflow).
- Dockerfile: This file contains a versioned Astro Runtime Docker image that provides a differentiated Airflow experience. If you want to execute other commands or overrides at runtime, specify them here.
- include: This folder contains any additional files that you want to include as part of your project. It is empty by default.
- packages.txt: Install OS-level packages needed for your project by adding them to this file. It is empty by default.
- requirements.txt: Install Python packages needed for your project by adding them to this file. It is empty by default.
- plugins: Add custom or community plugins for your project to this file. It is empty by default.
- airflow_settings.yaml: Use this local-only file to specify Airflow Connections, Variables, and Pools instead of entering them in the Airflow UI as you develop DAGs in this project.
